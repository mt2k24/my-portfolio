                        Hi, I'm <strong><%= name %></strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with
                        experience in both the technical support and development fields. Currently, I work as a
                        <strong>Software Support Engineer</strong> at <strong>Nevitech Data Solution</strong>, where I
                        troubleshoot software issues, provide technical support, and help clients optimize their
                        systems. This role has given me a deep understanding of the technical challenges that users
                        face, which I now use to build better and more intuitive software solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, I've honed my problem-solving skills and developed a keen interest in web
                        development. I have a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient, and
                        maintainable code. I have worked on several full-stack web projects and am constantly learning
                        and growing as I take on new challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm now actively seeking a developer role where I can apply my technical expertise, contribute
                        to innovative projects, and continue to grow as a software engineer. My goal is to leverage my
                        experience in both support and development to create user-focused solutions that make a real
                        impact.
